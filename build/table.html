<h1>Building the table and template holder</h1>
<h2>Building the table</h2>
<a href="table02-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=605>
<img src="table02.jpg" width=500 height=319 align=left></a>
Having built the <a href="pantograph.html">pantograph</a> and 
<a href="glides.html">sliding base</a>, I need
something to hold the stock in front of the router and
something to hold a template behind the pantograph.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table04-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=525>
<img src="table04.jpg" width=500 height=276 align=left></a>
<a href="table06-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=394>
<img src="table06.jpg" width=300 height=208 class="r"></a>
I'll start with the table on the front.  The design for this is almost 
the same as in my 
<a href="http://woodgears.ca/pantorouter/index.html">previous pantorouter</a>.
I prepared by gluing some pieces of wood together to get the full height
needed for the table supports.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table08-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=617>
<img src="table08.jpg" width=500 height=325 align=left></a>
<a href="table10-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=425>
<img src="table10.jpg" width=300 height=224 class="r"></a>
Instead of using a 1:1 printout of the whole sides, I made separate 
1:1 printouts of just the joints for this table (I'll include those
in the plans).  I paste these on the joined edges of the table pieces.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table12-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=611>
<img src="table12.jpg" width=500 height=322 align=left></a>
With the template glued on, I line it up one edge of one of the slots
with the saw blade, on my table saw sled.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table14-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=648>
<img src="table14.jpg" width=500 height=341 align=left></a>
Clamping a block of wood to the sled as a side stop
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table16-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=806>
<img src="table16.jpg" width=500 height=424 align=left></a>
<a href="table18-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=455>
<img src="table18.jpg" width=300 height=239 class="r"></a>
The slots and fingers are 13 mm wide, so I made two 26 mm wide blocks.
Inserting one of these between the stop block and the work piece allows
me to make the next cut without having to line things up by eye.
Then another block inserted, and the next cut made.
</p><br clear=left><p>

<a href="table20-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=556>
<img src="table20.jpg" width=500 height=293 align=left></a>
Next I line the blade up with the other side of a slot and repeat
the same procedure with both workpieces.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table22-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=596>
<img src="table22.jpg" width=500 height=314 align=left></a>
I hog out the material for the rest of the slot by making a series of cuts
with the saw blade, just positioning the workpiece freehand for each cut.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table24-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=598>
<img src="table24.jpg" width=500 height=315 align=left></a>
Next the fingers on the part that links the two pieces together.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table26-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=622>
<img src="table26.jpg" width=500 height=327 align=left></a>
Same procedure with the spacers.
<p>
Having cut the joints, the fingers were too wide to fit, so I positioned
the stop block to shave half a millimeter off each finger, again
using the spacers to position for each finger.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table28-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=590>
<img src="table28.jpg" width=500 height=310 align=left></a>
Gluing it together.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table30-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=550>
<img src="table30.jpg" width=500 height=290 align=left></a>
No need to clamp these joints, but I used one of my 
<a href="http://woodgears.ca/squares/">clamping squares</a>
to make sure the first joint stayed square as I glued the second one.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table32-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=683>
<img src="table32.jpg" width=500 height=360 align=left></a>
With my other pantorouter, I often found shavings accumulating in the
corner circled here.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table34-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=540>
<img src="table34.jpg" width=500 height=284 align=left></a>
<a href="table36-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=426>
<img src="table36.jpg" width=300 height=224 class="r"></a>
So I cut out a notch in the corners of the table support, just with 
a 45-degree cut on the table saw, then chip out the rest with a chisel.
</p><br clear=left><p>


<a href="table74-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=484>
<img src="table74.jpg" width=500 height=255 align=left></a>
The table top has a grid of holes in it for mounting the clamp onto.
I could have used a 1:1 template to mark these, but drawing the grid was
easy enough and saved me the trouble of peeling the paper off afterwards.
<p>
I'm using an awl, tapped with a hammer, to put a divot on each grid intersection...
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table76-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=656>
<img src="table76.jpg" width=500 height=345 align=left></a>
... then using a 25/64" (just slightly bigger than 3/8") drill to drill out the holes.
After that, I use a countersink bit to chamfer the edges of the holes.

</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table78-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=613>
<img src="table78.jpg" width=500 height=323 align=left></a>
And attaching the table top.  I'm only using four short screws for
the time being because I'll take it all apart again for varnishing later.
<p>
The table itself is screwed onto the base from the bottom, though I took no
photos of  that.

<h2>Building the template holder</h2>

<a href="table37-b.png" bigw=1000 bigh=880>
<img src="table37.png" width=500 height=440 align=left></a>
Next comes the template holder (highlighted in orange) which sits behind
the pantograph.
</p><br clear=left><p>


<a href="table38-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=534>
<img src="table38.jpg" width=500 height=281 align=left></a>
<a href="table40-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=434>
<img src="table40.jpg" width=300 height=229 class="r"></a>
I initially designed these joints to be cut with my 
<a href="http://woodgears.ca/box_joint/jig.html">screw advance box joint jig</a>,
but I wanted this machine to be easier to build for people who don't have
my fancy jigs.  So I had the idea of using the same method that I used to cut the
joints for the table.  But to make it easier, I changed the fingers to be 8 mm
wide from 6 mm.
<p>
I made some spacer blocks, one 16 mm wide (one finger + one space) and two
32 mm wide (two fingers and two spaces).
</p><br clear=left><p>

<a href="table42-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=607>
<img src="table42.jpg" width=500 height=319 align=left></a>
With the three spacers I can make any multiple of 16 mm.  This way I
get less cumulative error than using five equal blocks.
<p>
I knew the first slot leaves an 8 mm finger, so with the spacers in place,
I used my calipers to position the stop block so that there were 8 mm
between the last block and the blade.
I didn't bother pasting the templates onto the wood.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table44-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=649>
<img src="table44.jpg" width=500 height=341 align=left></a>
<a href="table46-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=455>
<img src="table46.jpg" width=300 height=240 class="r"></a>
Cutting the fingers.  First cutting the horizontal pieces, cutting the
slots in each end.  Then moving the block so that the next cut is the
other side of each 8 mm wide slot, then placing it freehand to make
two more cuts in between to hog out the 8 mm widths.
<p>
Except I made a mistake.  When I cut the joints on the verticals
pieces, after having cut the horizontal ones, I didn't offset
them correctly.  I should have started with the first 8 mm from
the edge cut away.  So I had to make these pieces a second time.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table48-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=851>
<img src="table48.jpg" width=500 height=448 align=left></a>
Test fitting the joints.
<p>
The vertical pieces are narrower at the top, but I hadn't cut
this away initially.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table50-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=493>
<img src="table50.jpg" width=500 height=259 align=left></a>
<a href="table51-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=477>
<img src="table51.jpg" width=300 height=251 class="r"></a>
I cut the straight part of this cut on the table saw, then cut the angled
part of the cut on the bandsaw.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table52-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=651>
<img src="table52.jpg" width=500 height=343 align=left></a>
The bottom horizontal piece also has a big square cut-out to make room
for the rear mounting block for the pantograph.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table54-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=534>
<img src="table54.jpg" width=500 height=281 align=left></a>
I also need to cut some slots into the template holder.
I'd normally cut these with my 
<a href="http://woodgears.ca/slot_mortiser/index.html">slot mortiser</a>,
but again, I have to make sure the machine is buildable without all my
jigs.  So I figured I should cut this out with a plunge router.
<p>
To make the work a bit easier, I hogged out some of the material by
drilling a series of 1/4" holes where the slots need to go.
<p>
It is possible to <a href="http://woodgears.ca/mortise/drillpress.html">
hog out a slot strictly with a drill</a> press, but it always
ends up messy looking.

</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table56-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=631>
<img src="table56.jpg" width=500 height=332 align=left></a>
<a href="table58-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=385>
<img src="table58.jpg" width=300 height=202 class="r"></a>
I then remove the rest of the material with a plunge router.  The router
has an attached fence to help me guide it.
<p>
I'm using a 3/8" straight router bit.  I have to route from both sides
to make it all the way through.
</p><br clear=left><p>

<a href="table60-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=534>
<img src="table60.jpg" width=500 height=281 align=left></a>
Slots cut.  The alignment wasn't perfect.  I could have cut the slots
faster and in less time using my slot mortiser.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table64-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=622>
<img src="table64.jpg" width=500 height=327 align=left></a>
<a href="table62-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=444>
<img src="table62.jpg" width=300 height=234 class="r"></a>
Finally, I drill the mounting holes in the bottom horizontal (I didn't
take any photos of that), and then glue the frame together.
<p>
After putting it together, I leave the frame lying flat on the table,
so that I don't accidentally introduce any twist with the clamps.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table66-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=618>
<img src="table66.jpg" width=500 height=325 align=left></a>
I also glue a strip of wood to the top, which gives me more room for clamping
templates on, especially when attaching templates with just clamps.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table68-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=773>
<img src="table68.jpg" width=500 height=407 align=left></a>
Placing screws in the mounting holes, and tapping them with a hammer to mark
the pilot hole locations.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table70-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=605>
<img src="table70.jpg" width=500 height=319 align=left></a>
Ideally, I'd drill the pilot holes on a drill press, but I didn't want to
take the whole thing apart again, so I'm drilling them freehand.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table72-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=534>
<img src="table72.jpg" width=500 height=281 align=left></a>
Then screwing on the template holder.  Just four screws for now,
because I'll have to take it all apart again later for varnishing.

<img src="table79.jpg" width=500 height=397 align=left></a>
The pantorouter so far.  I'm keen to try it out, and I really need
something to clamp the <A href="http://woodgears.ca/pantorouter/followers.html">
followers</a> to do a good job of that, so that's next
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table80-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=656>
<img src="table80.jpg" width=500 height=345 align=left></a>
<a href="table82-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=484>
<img src="table82.jpg" width=300 height=255 class="r"></a>
The follower clamp is a small block of wood that clamps to the operating lever.
I'm using a paper template for the shape of it.  It needs to be very precisely
made, to make sure the follower bearing doesn't mount crooked on the operating
lever.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="table86-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=739>
<img src="table86.jpg" width=500 height=389 align=left></a>
<a href="table84-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=472>
<img src="table84.jpg" width=300 height=248 class="r"></a>
A hole goes through the side to allow a bolt and knob to squeeze the block
together, clamping the 1/4" (6 mm) shaft for the follower bearing in place.

<a href="table88-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=634>
<img src="table88.jpg" width=500 height=334 align=left></a>
Testing it out, using a multiple-mortise template.  I first made this template
for some joints for a <a href="http://woodgears.ca/mirror_stand/">mirror stand</a>.

<a href="table89-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=775>

<a href="table92-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=669>
<img src="table92.jpg" width=500 height=352 align=left></a>
The fit was less than perfect.  I must have some minor geometry error in the
pantograph.  I will have to check that later.
