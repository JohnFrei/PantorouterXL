While building the pantorouter, I made a few test joints.
The mortise and tenon joint at left worked out perfectly, but the
multiple mortise and tenon joint at right didn't fit as well as it
should.
<p>
The spacing between the tenons is a bit smaller than that of the
mortises, and I had to cut the joint with some slack (using a smaller follower)
to be able to assemble it at all. 
The distortions would, to some extent, be the same for both sides
of the joint, except that I cut the tenon piece lying flat on the table
(with the tenons oriented vertically), whereas the mortises were oriented
horizontally.  So it appears there is some distortion introduced by the
pantograph.

So far, I hadn't checked my pantograph components for accuracy, 
so I suspected some might be a little bit off.  But before
taking the pantograph apart, I figured I should check how the router
aligns with the table.  I mounted a piece of 1/4" steel rod in the
router.

<a href="adjust10-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=392>
<img src="adjust10.jpg" width=300 height=207 class="r"></a>

The rod rested flat on the table along the full width of the table, so
it appears that aspect is accurate.

<p>
But checking with a square, I could tell that it was not square to the
edge of the table.  Also, plunging in and out, I could see the shaft
move to the side a little bit as the router moved forwards and bac, 
so the router axis was also not parallel to the plunge.

Time to take the pantograph out of the machine.  Pulling the shafts out
is difficult.  I used the clamps from the <a href="plunge.html">plunge
stops</a> to grab the shafts as I pulled them out.

<a href="adjust16-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=493>
<img src="adjust16.jpg" width=500 height=259 align=left></a>
Using another shaft, and a mallet to drive the first shaft out works
too.  Push the shaft half way through, then pull both shafts out from
either side.

Now checking the links for length and twist.
<p>
Twist is easy to check.  With pins in the holes, I rest the links on
some straight pieces of wood on a flat surface.  If it rocks back and
forth (like a wobbly chair), then the link has a twist.
<p>
I measured about 0.010" (about 0.25 mm) of rocking on the long link.

</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="adjust22-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=462>
<img src="adjust22.jpg" width=500 height=243 align=left></a>
I measured the spacing between the shafts by hooking a tape measure 
on one shaft, then measuring to  the near edge of the other shaft.
Should be 36 cm to the near edge for the long link.  This one is spot on.

<a href="adjust26-b.jpg" bigw=456 bigh=372>
<img src="adjust26.jpg" width=240 height=196 class="r"></a>
One side of the short link was nearly half a millimeter too long, 
but it also had some twist.  The dial indicator showed 0.015" (0.3 mm)
of rocking.  Given that it's a short link, that was a bit much.

<a href="adjust30-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=439>
<img src="adjust30.jpg" width=300 height=231 class="r"></a>
The biggest inaccuracy I found was the length of the router mount link.
The shafts were a full 1.5 mm too far apart!  That probably
accounts for most of the inaccuracy.

Rather than make the part again, I figured I should try to "fix" it.
First I cut a section of 3/16" x 3/16" maple square
on  the table saw.  Then I whittled it to an octagonal shape
using a small hand plane.  
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="adjust36-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=554>
<img src="adjust36.jpg" width=500 height=291 align=left></a>
I used the octagonal piece as a dowel to plug the holes that
needed to be changed.

Driving a peg into the pantograph link's hole.
I gave the glue a day to dry before re-drilling.

<img src="adjust42.jpg" width=300 height=232 class="r"></a>
Then carefully measuring where the hole <i>actually</i> needs to be.  I
used an awl to punch a divot in the new hole position.  But now, how to
drill this without allowing the drill to wander?
<p>
So I drilled a hole in another piece of hardwood with the drill I wanted
to use.  I then stuck the drill bit in that hole, with just the middle
of the drill's points protruding, and placed that point in the divot.
I then firmly clamped the piece of wood in place.

<a href="adjust46-b.jpg" bigw=475 bigh=376>
<img src="adjust46.jpg" width=250 height=198 class="r"></a>
With the clamped on piece of wood guiding the drill, I was able 
to re-drill a new, overlapping hole.  It worked out ok, so I didn't need
to make a new piece.

<img src="adjust50.jpg" width=300 height=202 class="r"></a>
I wasn't sure whether the error in the short link was worth fixing,
but I figured while I'm at it, I might as well try.
I glued a piece of dowel in the hole and gave that a day to dry.

The twist that I was trying to correct was really quite small, so I have
to be very accurate about marking to get it more accurate than it was.
With the piece supported on the
shafts in the other three positions, I used  the point of a 3/16" drill
bit to scratch the center line of where the hole should be and
carefully measured the distance to the other shaft.
<p>
I then use the same technique as with the router mount link to make sure
the hole went in the right place.

Checking the plunge sled accuracy.  The main pivot for the pantograph
was not perpendicular to the table edge, nor was it parallel to the
plunge direction.  I checked it by measuring sideways movement with
a dial indicator while moving the plunge sled in and out.
<p>
My procedure to make sure the rails were parallel to each
other  did not include making sure the plunge sled was aligned with the
rails.  I also only used two screws instead of four on each rail, so
I had quite a bit of slack, and, though parallel, the rails were not square
to the wood when I tightened the nuts.
<p>
So I loosened the nuts, adjusted it, and retightened.
After that, everything was aligned.
