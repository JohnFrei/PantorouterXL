<h1>Making linear glides for the plunge mechanism</h1>

Having <a href="pantograph.html">built the pantograph mechanism</a>
for my new pantorouter XL,
I next need some linear glides to allow the base that the pantograph
mounts to move forwards and back (parallel to the router's axis)
<p>
But this pantorouter is designed to take a plunge router, so why
not just just use the router's own plunge mechanism for the plunge
action?

</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides04-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=699>
<img src="glides04.jpg" width=500 height=368 align=left></a>
The problem with the plunge mechanism on the router itself is that it's
difficult to activate and it doesn't have enough plunge range. 
With the pantorouter, when cutting tenons, those are typically cut with
the stock overhanging the end of the table (shown at left).  But when cutting
mortises, the stock is mounted on the table, so the router needs to come
further forward to plunge above the table.
<p>
The router's own plunge mechanism doesn't have enough travel to allow for
both.

<a href="glides06-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=585>
<img src="glides06.jpg" width=500 height=308 align=left></a>
A good solution for the plunge action is to use polished steel rods
and linear bearings, as is done with the <a
href="http://woodgears.ca/pantorouter/kuldeep/">all metal
pantorouter</a>. But these are expensive, and you can't just walk into
your local hardware store and buy them.
<p>
Another downside of linear glides is that they add a lot of height.

I'm going to use drawer glides.  However,  full extension slides, such
as the one shown at left,  with two glides telescoping tend to have too
much play in them and are unsuitable. Unfortunately, most full extension
drawer slides are of this variety, so you have to look around to find a
slide that is suitable.

</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides08-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=651>
<img src="glides08.jpg" width=500 height=343 align=left></a>
Suitable for this type of work are glides with just one set of balls.
These include good quality keyboard drawer slides, older style two-tier
full extension drawer slides, and center drawer glides.  The slide
at the bottom of the photo is a full extension slide that is <i>not</i>
suitable.
<p>
The center drawer slides (one still in the package at left) are a good
find, in that they are very close to what I need.  I found these at
Lowes.  And Lowes also sells the springs you will need for a later part
of the build, so it's worth a visit  (Home Depot sells neither part).

</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides10-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=361>
<img src="glides10.jpg" width=500 height=190 align=left></a>
The center drawer slides have a mounting piece that is easy to pull
off one  end.  And the slides themselves can also be separated by
pulling hard on them.

With the inside part pulled out, we have what I like to call the "ball
cage" which holds the bearing balls in place.  Metal tabs on either end of
the outside track keep the ball cage from moving too far.
<p>
For these modifications, I need remove one of the tabs (arrow in red).  
I ground it off with a bench grinder.  I could have flattened it 
with a hammer as well, but that risks bending the track.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides16-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=467>
<img src="glides16.jpg" width=500 height=246 align=left></a>
The particles from grinding have contaminated the grease on the
track, so I'm wiping all the grease off for now.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides18-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=548>
<img src="glides18.jpg" width=500 height=288 align=left></a>
I only need 12 cm range of motion.  To beef up the linear
glide, I'm going to add another ball cage.  I'm taking these off some
other ball glides that I pulled out of the garbage. Fortunately, most of
the good quality ball glides have the same profile and ball size.

<a href="glides20-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=616>
<img src="glides20.jpg" width=500 height=324 align=left></a>
Cutting the extra ball cage to length.  I need a total length of 
33 cm between the two of them.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides22-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=656>
<img src="glides22.jpg" width=500 height=345 align=left></a>
<a href="glides24-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=313>
<img src="glides24.jpg" width=300 height=165 class="r"></a>
Also cutting the outside track to length.  I want it to be about
43 cm in length.
<p>
The hacksaw leaves a bit of a burr on the metal, so I'm cleaning
the edge with a file.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides26-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=624>
<img src="glides26.jpg" width=500 height=329 align=left></a>
<a href="glides28-b.jpg" bigw=456 bigh=340>
<img src="glides28.jpg" width=240 height=179 class="r"></a>
Having cut the inside track to the right length, I cut some slots in the
end of it and am bent a tab on it.  This hook catches the ball cages
and will help keep them in place.

<a href="glides30-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=490>
<img src="glides30.jpg" width=500 height=258 align=left></a>
Last time I <a href="http://woodgears.ca/pantorouter/glides.html">
adapted some linear glides</a>, the glides I used had a small amount of
play in them. I eliminated that by squeezing the track together a bit in
a vise - being careful to not over-squeeze it (with lots of squeezing
and testing), and always making sure the balls are not where the track
is being squeezed.  You may have to do this with yours.  The tracks I
bought from Lowes were tight to begin with, so this wasn't necessary.

</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides32-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=495>
<img src="glides32.jpg" width=500 height=260 align=left></a>
Next I need to drill mounting holes.  That is done with the tracks
completely disassembled. With one of the limit stops ground off earlier,
I can pull the glide completely apart, catching all the ball-bearing
balls in a container as they come out.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides34-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=559>
<img src="glides34.jpg" width=500 height=294 align=left></a>
<a href="glides36-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=436>
<img src="glides36.jpg" width=300 height=229 class="r"></a>
I'm mostly using existing holes, but a few new holes need to be drilled
as well.  I'm using calipers to scratch where the new holes go,
measuring from the existing holes.  This way, I'm able to establish the
new hole locations very consistently.
<p>
I then use a center punch to put a divot where the holes need to go.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides38-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=592>
<img src="glides38.jpg" width=500 height=312 align=left></a>
The divot helps to guide the drill in the right place.  Without a divot
in the metal, the spinning drill would wander a bit before starting to drill.  
It's really nearly impossible to start an accurate hole without a divot.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides39-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=700>
<img src="glides39.jpg" width=500 height=368 align=left></a>
<a href="glides40-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=357>
<img src="glides40.jpg" width=300 height=188 class="r"></a>
I drilled a small (1/8" or 3 mm) pilot hole, then a larger hole for the
screws, and then used the tip of a larger drill to chamfer the edges of
the holes for mounting some countersink screws. I'm using 8-32 screws
(for Metric countries, use M5 screws)
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides42-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=340>
<img src="glides42.jpg" width=300 height=179 class="r"></a>
<a href="glides43-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=551>
<img src="glides43.jpg" width=500 height=290 align=left></a>
Finally, de-burring some of the holes with a larger drill in my hand
drill, with just light pressure applied and letting the bit spin for a few
turns against the holes.

</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides46-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=648>
<img src="glides46.jpg" width=500 height=341 align=left></a>
<a href="glides44-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=349>
<img src="glides44.jpg" width=300 height=184 class="r"></a>
Next I need to mount the wider outside tracks to the bottom of the 
"sled" that the pantograph mounts on.  These need to be spaced 26 cm 
apart and need to be exactly parallel.
<p>
I made two spacers on the table saw.  These are designed to catch
the same edge of both slides, so that the center to center spacing
will be the same, regardless of the slide width.  I cut these from
one piece of wood, then cut that down the middle to make sure 
I had two spacers of exactly the same length.
<p>
I then use these to position the glides just right...
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides48-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=601>
<img src="glides48.jpg" width=500 height=317 align=left></a>
...then mark where the holes need to go...
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides50-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=614>
<img src="glides50.jpg" width=500 height=323 align=left></a>
... and use an awl to put a divot at the center of each mark.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides52-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=667>
<img src="glides52.jpg" width=500 height=351 align=left></a>
<a href="glides54-b.jpg" bigw=570 bigh=443>
<img src="glides54.jpg" width=300 height=233 class="r"></a>
I drill holes for the screws, 3/16" (5 mm) in diameter.  This leaves a
bit of slack for the #8 screws so that I can make fine adjustments
later.
<p>
I also drill a 5/8" (16 mm) hole from the opposite side, deep enough
for a nut and washer to fit below the surface.  Make sure your nut
driver or socket set fits in the holes (or drill the holes larger)
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides56-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=534>
<img src="glides56.jpg" width=500 height=281 align=left></a>
<a href="glides58-b.jpg" bigw=456 bigh=296>
<img src="glides58.jpg" width=240 height=156 class="r"></a>
Screwing the rails on.  Getting the nuts and washers on is always a
fiddly task. I use a nut-driver to tighten the nut in the hole.
</p><br clear=left><p>

<a href="glides60-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=601>
<img src="glides60.jpg" width=500 height=317 align=left></a>
Next I need to mount the inside tracks on the base of the machine.
These are slightly shorter.  The idea is, as the top slides back and
forth, the track below will always be covered by the table above it.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides62-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=594>
<img src="glides62.jpg" width=500 height=313 align=left></a>
I'm using the same spacers to lay these out as I did for the sliding
part.  Because they both reference the same edge on both parts, they
still produce the same spacing for the narrower tracks. 
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides66-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=694>
<img src="glides66.jpg" width=500 height=365 align=left></a>
<a href="glides68-b.jpg" bigw=456 bigh=352>
<img src="glides68.jpg" width=240 height=185 class="r"></a>
Again, getting the nuts and washers into the holes is a fiddly affair.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides69-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=624>
<img src="glides69.jpg" width=500 height=328 align=left></a>
Now putting the ball cages and balls back in.  Getting the balls in is
also fiddly.  I cleaned the tracks, ball cages
and balls of any grease, seeing that all my other work may have
contaminated the grease.
<p>
I'm not re-adding any grease for the time being, because this is not the
final assembly.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides70-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=608>
<img src="glides70.jpg" width=500 height=320 align=left></a>
It works reasonably well to hold a ball from either side with each hand
as and push the ball cage in by one ball increment at a time.  I'm only
placing a ball in every third position for now.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides71-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=691>
<img src="glides71.jpg" width=500 height=364 align=left></a>
<a href="glides72-b.jpg" bigw=456 bigh=303>
<img src="glides72.jpg" width=240 height=160 class="r"></a>
In the original slides, tabs prevented the ball cages from sliding out of
the outside track.  But with one of the tabs ground off, I added a screw
at the end of the track to keep the ball cage from coming out.  I put
that screw towards the side because it was the only safe place to be 
clear of the middle track, with its tab that also has to move past 
the end of the track.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides74-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=527>
<img src="glides74.jpg" width=500 height=277 align=left></a>
I'm mating the tracks together.  The tracks on the base are parallel
and firmly screwed down, while the tracks on the sled have the screws
left loose.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides76-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=609>
<img src="glides76.jpg" width=500 height=321 align=left></a>
Once the two parts are slid together, the slack in the mount should now
allow the tracks to mate precisely.  I can now tighten the screws in the
sled to make sure everything is locked in place.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="glides78-b.jpg" bigw=950 bigh=534>
<img src="glides78.jpg" width=500 height=281 align=left></a>
Glides complete.
<p>
An advantage of using ball glides is that they slide easily, even under
pressure.  That way, I can push the plunge slide forward and back from
the side without risk of racking (jamming diagonally).
<p>
Next step is to build the table and template holder.
