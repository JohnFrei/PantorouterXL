This is with the plunge lever all the way back.  If you are using a large router, wit ha large
bit, and want to cut tenons one small step at a time, then you might want to move the
router further back, by using one of the extra holes in plunge lever link.

It's important that the plunge lever does not interfere with the pantograph operating
lever, even when the router is in it's fully forward position.  It's best just
move the router forward as far as it will go, and the lever just barely clearing the operating
lever and then mark where the best location for the screw that attaches the plunge lever
link to the table.

The spring cam on the back turns the short link (which is parallel to the operating lever).
This link is only loosely placed on the shafts.
<p>
Also note a small wedge between the template holder frame and the rear pantograph mount.
I had some misalignment, and this wedge helps to push the pantograph mount to  the right
a little bit, which brings the pantograph's main axis into better alignment.

Space around the plunge lever link is tight.  Just below it is the depth stop mechanism,
though the clamps for this are below the table, to make them easier to reach.
<p>
The top inside edge of the plunge lever link is also beveled, to make room
for the router when it's brought all the way to the operator side.
